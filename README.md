# ABC-COMPANY-EMPLOYEE-DATA-ANALYSIS
# Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive employee report for ABC Company using a dataset of 458 rows and 9 columns. The objective is to preprocess, analyze, and visualize employee data to provide actionable insights about the workforce.
# Preprocessing
Replace the "height" column with random values between 150 and 180.
Ensure data consistency and integrity before performing the analysis.
# Analysis Tasks
.Employee Distribution: Analyze and calculate the percentage of employees in each team.
.Position Segregation: Categorize employees based on their positions within the company.
.Age Group Insights: Identify the predominant age group among employees.
.Salary Expenditure: Determine which team and position account for the highest salary expenditure.
.Age-Salary Correlation: Explore any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.
# Graphical Representation
Created visualizations for each of the five analysis tasks to effectively communicate findings:

# Distribution charts
Column charts,
Bar graphs,
Scatter plots, etc.

# insights gained from dataset.
1. Employee Distribution Across Teams
Insight: The dataset reveals the distribution of employees across various teams. Certain teams, such as [New Orleans Pelicans], have the highest number of employees, indicating a focus on that area. On the other hand, [Minnesota Timberwolves] has the fewest, suggesting it may have specialized or niche roles.
2. Position Segregation
Insight: Employees are grouped into distinct positions within the company, such as Managers, Executives, and Analysts. The analysis highlights that [SG] accounts for the majority of employees, reflecting the company's operational focus. Conversely, [C] has the least representation, possibly due to the specialized nature of these roles.
3. Predominant Age Group
Insight: The most common age group among employees is [20-30], indicating a workforce predominantly composed of [early-career, mid-career, or experienced professionals]. This insight could help tailor HR strategies like training or benefits to the demographic's needs.
4. Salary Expenditure
Insight:
Team with Highest Salary: [Los Angeles Leakers] incures the highest salary expenditure, reflecting either the number of employees or the high value of roles within this team.
Position with Highest Salary: [SF] commands the highest salary, which is likely attributed to the specialized skills and responsibilities associated with this role.
5. Age-Salary Correlation
Insight:
The correlation analysis reveals a [positive/negative/neutral] relationship between age and salary. For instance, older employees might earn higher salaries due to seniority, or there could be an even distribution across all ages.
The scatter plot visualization illustrates the trend, helping to identify potential outliers or exceptions (e.g., younger employees with significantly high salaries).
